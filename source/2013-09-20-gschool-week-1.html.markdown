Two weeks down. Many to go. Although the actual number of days we have spent here is still very small, the learning curve has been steep, and I already feel much more comfortable than I did last week. It's hard to realize how much has sunk in, but where I am now versus last week is a big change. 

Having completed "v1.0" of Event Reporter, I've learned the most about how to tackle the "unknown". Having to load, parse and format CSV data has been strange to get used to, especially staying organized and keeping all of the tags and data in the right place, but I feel great having pushed my way through. It's incredible to have so many people as resources here, and it's refreshing to have everyone so willing to help out, even at the expense of their own time and effort. Now, being able to type commands separated by spaces instead of calling methods on instances, I can see the extensions of the underlying code, and how we can shape it to create a more intuitive experience.

Looking back on all of the work that went in to Event Reporter, I can see a lot of opportunity for improvement. Putting in the long, long, long days paid off, and I feel confident and comfortable with the work. But, I know there is a lot of cleaning up to do... My goal for the next project, or even with refactoring this project, is to stay organized by not having one long class and file. I'm just beginning to really understand how to create multiple classes and files and to split off the code into smaller and more manageable chunks, rather than scrolling aimlessly to find the right method to fix. Nil error messages still, and always will, suck.
