The wide world of the web... Up until our detailed explanation of the internet and how it works (DNS and such) it was this mystical beast that was always out of reach. In the end, even with all of its complexity, it makes a lot more sense now, and makes me excited to take the power of building applications and programs and weaving them into an online platform. I've never experienced HTML or CSS much previously, but it is nice to see how much freedom it can give, as well as how easy it is to learn from existing websites.

In my first go with Sinatra, I have yet to really feel like I know enough to have absolute control over the application. This is to be expected, of course, since it is all new syntax. But, I feel like I am understanding more and more each day, and look forward to having the knowledge and confidence to be out on my own and create something I can be proud of. 

Since it is the first week with Sinatra, it has dominated my time and attention. Nothing about it is terribly complex, but there are aspects of the tutorial or with Sinatra that require a 'leap' and have left me with the desire to know why something is the way it is. I wish I would have had a better balance of project work and other work (reading, review etc), but I think for now it's fine the way it turned out. I am still learning new and important things, and really enjoying everything along the way, and that's really what matters in the end. 

Having it as an "individual" project hasn't really changed my opinion of the process. I find I'm still asking questions, giving advice to others when I can, and interracting with others frequently. I do like how I have the freedom to choose the features I want to attempt to tackle, and eventually have the choice to design and orient the application the way that I want. In addition, having an assigned "group" of support has been great. Not only can we ask anyone for help, but having a designated number of people makes asking for help a lot for familiar and comfortable, and has bred a great sense of "we are all in this together."

It's amazing to look at a calendar and see that six weeks have passed... It has screamed by, and had a lot of information and progress crammed into it. I feel confident with where I am now, even though I know that there is much improvement and strengthening to do. I don't want to rely on my memory or memorizing specific ways to do a problem, but rather want to <em>really</em> know the tools that I can apply to any problem that presents itself. I think my strongest aspect of the past 6 weeks has been the growth I have made since day 1. I have loved that everything has been challenging, and having to really push myself to learn and understand has proven incredibly rewarding and important. I still have so much to learn and strengthen, and I look forward to the weeks to come.
