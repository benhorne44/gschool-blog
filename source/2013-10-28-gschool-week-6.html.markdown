  Even though we have spent almost two hard-working months here at gSchool, I still find myself full of energy and excitement for what is to come. This past week, we finished up our IdeaBox project while working with Sinatra. Looking back, I see how simple and communicative Sinatra can be. I know that my understanding of web apps needs to grow (and I certainly expect it to) but I feel that I learned a lot in the past week. I never felt uncomfortable about the Ruby side of the project, and worked slowly and steadily to develop tests before adding each new feature. 

  But, many of the questions I needed to ask related to the web side of things, mainly about what the "right" or "better" way to do something is. I can hack something together, but I also want to have some direction with how it should go. In that sense, the last project worked great to have the individual freedom to pick and choose what to do next, but to still have smaller "support groups" as a means to ask questions and get feedback. The language and syntax of web apps is still growing, but Sinatra was a nice intro to how to organize and manage our apps on the web.

  I knew going in to this project that I wanted to focus on more testing. So, after completing the tutorial the first time, I made it a priority to attempt TDD and focus on how adding new features could properly interract with each other. Whether or not all of my tests fall under the category of "good tests", I view it all as an important first step. I think that I will only begin to really understand good testing once I can look back at existing work and re-tool it. It's better to get some ideas on the page than to get stuck trying to write the perfect test. 

  Overall, I thought that my testing was great for the Ruby. Every feature had at least a couple of tests (again, not all were necessarily great). The big thing I took away from that was confidence. I felt confident that I was working efficiently and productively, and that I could trust myself to implement new features with this plan. Also, when something inevitably went wrong, I felt confident that I could narrow down the problem, fix it, and move on by looking at how the test results changed. 

  Testing the Sinatra part was a bit of a different story, where I relied more on clicking and "visiting" the site. It felt more natural to me to check the app functionality with the web on the internet, and to see how it felt navigating the buttons, links and forms.

  If I could redo the project, I would focus more on keeping clear, concise and organized view files. Initially, I put too much ruby and "thinking" in the views, and had to go back and remove it in my attempts to clean everything up. I attempted to ignore proper indentation (a dumb idea) to try and save time, but really ended up confusing myself visually more than I should have. Working slowly to keep things clean and clear would absolutely limit how much work would need to be done on the other end.

  Code Retreat was a great change of location. It was nice to get out of the classroom and Galvanize to keep things fresh and interesting. Plus, I think The Source is an interesting and exciting place. I don't know whether or not it was the "right" place for everyone, but I enjoyed it. Sometimes great things can come from a simple change like location. In terms of the work done, I think it could have been split up a bit more. Rather than do two large sessions for each problem, and repeating it a number of times (3?) adding a third section could have helped keep everyone's attention. I know that part of the intention of the day is to repeat the same work but with different constraints, but by the third iteration, the theme of the work began to get a bit boring, or at the least felt overdone. 

  On a very positive note, I really liked the constraints that we had. My favorite, and surprisingly most productive in terms of completion, was the constraint of not talking to your partner and having to switch after typing each line. Although it seemed like this was going to hinder us and slow us down, it forced us to think before we wrote, which worked as a nice filter for potentially erroneous ideas. It felt that by having to write only one line at a time, you had to make the method names clear and express your intentions very neatly and deliberately, which only improved the quality of the writing. 

  Another great aspect of the Code Retreat was the interraction with others. I found that (by accident) I ended up working with people who I have only had limited coding experience with. I really enjoyed this aspect of the day, and love how diverse the personalities and approaches are in the class.
