Week 7
------

This week was all about tradeoffs. First, with a short project, our group knew that we were not going to be able to accomplish everything that we would normally like. Typically, for a project, I like to have time to go back, edit and re-tool a project to clean it up, but did not have that luxury this time around. 

However, I do feel that I gained at least as much new knowledge as I had hoped. Having had to barrel our way through this project without much prior knowledge of a database and CMS, we paired through it all so that everyone could work on the skills. Sinatra is a great tool for whipping up a basic site. Not that "basic" refers to an inferior product, but the ease at which one can build features and an app is incredible. In the end, the SQL and Sequel aspects of the project went a lot better than expected. They still took time to disect and understand, but the language and logic to how they work is very sensical and straight forward. 

Again, I realized how much time HTML/CSS can take. Even though it was put on the back-burner, it was painfully obvious how our functionality was lessened by its appearance, and that a clean and professional looking site enhances what it can actually do. This will be a goal for future projects. 

I feel decent about acceptance testing. I am still trying to understand the tradeoffs of writing tests for content or testing manually by visiting the site. But, there were times in this project where a test failed because the view template was not loading, or had the wrong content inside of it. In that sense, it was quite helpful. A goal for the future will be to incorporate Capybara to allow for more detailed testing of buttons and forms, and to make sure that a link behaves the way it should. 

My wish, looking back, would have been for more time. This felt like a project cut short. With another week, I know our group could have made the site look great and have much more detailed and advanced capabilities. We could have made the admin powers greater, to be able to upload or change images, add pages, delete pages etc... A more dynamic interraction with the content would have been great as well (such as a collapsable navbar on one of the sides). 

I don't know for sure that the 3 person group really felt that different than my past experiences. I had already been in a 3 person group for SalesEngine, which was a longer and more intense project, and experienced how to divide the workload, "pair" as a large group, and interract with one another in a productive and open manner. Honest communication is always tough, especially with the weight of a project and deadlines... I look forward to more opportunities to work with even larger groups in the future.
