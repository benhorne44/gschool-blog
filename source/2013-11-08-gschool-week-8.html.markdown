Lightening talk DONE! I know that I always need more practice in public speaking, and in it's nice to have a framework like this to improve. Also, the topic of factories was approachable and easy enough to structure, so I felt a lot of practical lessons were learned, and I imagine myself using factories and fixtures in the future.

But, one downside to the talk was that it took time away from Dinner Dash. I do feel that we have made a lot of progress on the project, but not as much as I would have liked at this point. Of course, that sentiment is true for every project, where our goals and motivations often outstretch the realities of programming. We have made sure to keep our project functional at each step. Pushing to Heroku was a priority for us, and now that we have that functioning, we have freed up a lot of potential frustration. I'm excited for what we will accomplish from here.

Our project style has had many different iterations, but I feel that each of us has contributed to the project, and in different ways. We have been able to individually add features, data etc. and make it work. It is a very interesting project in terms of features, and I really feel that I have learned a lot not only about Rails, but about web development in general.

That said, learning Rails has been an interesting ride. To some degree, it's un-learning what we have done in the past. Where we used to write lines and lines of code, Rails now has a simple method call. It allows us to get rid of any bad habits we may have had, but there are a lot of "free" features that almost seem too easy. I'm getting more used to how things are organized and what resources are available in different classes. 

The question that I have in my mind is always about the *better* way to approach structuring an app. Yes, I know that I can do this one way, but what's the conventional approach in the real world? To make the code *cleaner* I want to be organized and concise, and practice will be the best way to get there. It has been really rewarding to learn about how apps and users interract, and how to make features a reality in code.

Learning Rails is like studying vocab for the SAT. It's all based in the same language, but there are different ways to accomplish the same meaning and we need to keep memorizing and using these variations. So, part of it is memorization, and part of it is practice, where we force ourselves to *use* the new terms and eventually make them automatic.
