The last week and change has been really interesting and fun. Starting with code retreat, it was great to return to applying basic ruby thinking and organization to the Battleship game. First off, the location was great at iTriage. Regardless of the type of work that they do there, they have incubated a wonderful and interesting environment in which to work, and everyone there appeared incredibly satisfied and happy. 

The Battleship game itself was interesting as well. Given the large scope of the game, there was no way to finish it in an hour. But, by having different constraints and approaching the game in many ways gave me the feeling that I could, if given enough time, build a full game. The first session was pretty tough, figuring out how to narrowly define the first steps, but the process got better and better as the day went on. 

The game itself was great practice in not repeating code. Since many of the ships and players are related, it was easy to repeat code, but then pay for it in maintanance costs. So, learning how to structure objects and define their unique attributes on the fly was a great way to have one point of entry and keep the code to a minimum. 

Dinner Dash was a slow-starting intro to Rails. Beyond learning the core vocabulary and structure of rails, it was a tough balance of how to structure the project itself, and how to plan each day's workload. In the end, I think our scope was a bit too wide, and some features weren't completed to the extent that I would have liked. But, I know that each of us contributed and should feel good about the product we created. Much of the JavaScript and jQuery magic makes more sense now, but at the time was something I didn't try and understand. I look forward to trying to add these features to future projects.

Overall, JavaScript seems like it will be more about memorizing symbols and syntax than the structure itself. Having learned Ruby first, the structure of the logic and how things interract makes more sense than I thought it would. But, it is very different from Ruby in a lot of ways, and that will be the biggest hurdle I see in learning it. I know that even though the examples we are working through now are not difficult (compared to *real* projects) it is a great place to build confidence and learn the basics. I can see my creative side interracting with JavaScript well, and I look forward to the future.
