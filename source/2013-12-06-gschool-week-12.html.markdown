I love the opportunity to improve my project management. It's an area that typically requires experience, and cannot necessarily be "learned" by studying. So, having a focus on planning and management is a great way to learn better practices, and begin to apply them to our project, allowing repetition and time to affirm them in our programming style. Since the beginning of the program, one of the hardest parts of working on a project is figuring out how to break apart the "final" product into the smallest and most manageable pieces. There are so many different avenues to take in planning a project, but so far this week it has been great to have more guidance, and I feel that all that we have done has made sense to do first. Progress has been steady, and it feels like we are at a great spot, even though we have yet to split up work and be "efficient" in how we can maximize individual efforts. Working together has rightly allowed all of us to stay together and maintain a common level of understanding of where the project is.

Working with a previous project has had mostly ups, and a few "downs". Originally, we chose a project with the fewest bells and whistles, so that we could build what we wanted on top of it. However, it became quite apparent that the choices that were made in the project, and how orders/carts etc. were defined would prove incredibly frustrating and difficult. But, we switched to another project, that had a strong foundation in testing and code quality. So, we are now just hooking up the wires to extend the old functionality to the new site. 

Zoom! Over halfway done... Again, it really feels like the program has gone by so quickly. Before I know it, we will be at our holiday break, and once 2014 starts, I think I will really feel the "final push". I think my progress is still strong, and that I am continuing at a similar rate to the beginning of the class. That said, I know that there is a lot that I want to keep learning and getting better at. I feel strongly that my momentum is still strong. 

The YE project will be a great experience. I know that, at times, I will wish that I could devote that time to a project or something else (sleep?), but I need more experience on design and building the front end of a website. It will take time, but will be worth it.
