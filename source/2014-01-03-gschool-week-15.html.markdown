With 56 days left until the end of the program, it's going to be a fun and exciting final push. I have been amazed at how fast everything has gone, and although it would seem like it has gone by too fast, when I look at the progress of the class, and what we each have learned, it feels a lot more natural. From here on, I want to continue to solidify what I already know, and continue to expand my knowledge into other areas I am interested in. Granted, I don't expect to learn a new language, but I want to chip away at learning more about what is out there. Also, I want to make sure that I push myself right up to the end. I don't think that will be much of an issue, but it's something that I consciously want to focus on.

Between now and then, I want to narrow down my areas of interest, and apply those to the job process. Right now I can see myself in a lot of different places, but feel that with some guidance and thought, I can really find a perfect fit for the first job. I've been proud of my work so far, and I want to look back on the entire 6 months with the same pride.

I think any "blocker" to my goals of widening my learning will be that I will not focus enough on one thing, and instead will scratch the surface on too many things. I know it's better to know fewer things more solidly, so I hope that I am able to really stick to a couple topics and work them through.

To achieve my best outcome, I need to continue to push myself as I have up until this point. I have never been one to slack off or give up, so I don't intend for that to happen. That said, I feel that I have given my best effort to this point, and that is what is important for me to continue. I need to keep focusing on sleep, exercise, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

The people around me (students and teachers) have been and will be what helps me the most. I have learned an incredible amount through others, and feeding off of their energy and inspiration allows me to stay focused, feel energized and continue pushing on.
